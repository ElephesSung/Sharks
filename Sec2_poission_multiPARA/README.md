# Second Section: multi-parameter poission process with Bayesian Inference

For the first section, we only have one parameter, which is the killing rate, for the mathematical model of NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Here we introduce multiple parameters to further study the homogenenous and heterogenous of the NK cell population and how the environmental variation change the NK cell cytotoxicity.
